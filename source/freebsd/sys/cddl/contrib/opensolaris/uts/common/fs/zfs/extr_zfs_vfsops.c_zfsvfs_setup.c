		 * ziltest causes spa_sync() to think it's committed,

		 * In particular, if object N is in the unlinked set in

		 * actually freed in a later txg and then reallocated
		 * in a yet later txg.  This would write a "create
		 * object N" record to the intent log.  Normally, this
		 * would be fine because the spa_sync() would have
		 * written out the fact that object N is free, before
		 * we could write the "create object N" intent log
		 * record.
		 *
		 * But when we are in ziltest mode, we advance the "open
		 * txg" without actually spa_sync()-ing the changes to
		 * disk.  So we would see that object N is still
		 * allocated and in the unlinked set, and there is an
		 * intent log record saying to allocate it.
